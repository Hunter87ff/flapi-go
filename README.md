# flapi-go
A rewrite version of Flapi on top of Go/Fiber, aiming to bring more fast and efficient mock server for API development. to reduce resource consumption and memory footprint, improve request handling speed and throughput, maintain the simplicity of the original Flapi API, and add Go-specific optimizations and features.


## Features (Planned)
- Dynamic mock data generation
- RESTful API mocking
- Template-based response customization
- Flexible data schemas
- Response delay simulation
- Conditional responses
- Custom response headers
- HTTP method handling
- Multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.)


## Migration from FastAPI
flapi-go is a ground-up rewrite of the original Flapi project, moving from Python/FastAPI to Go. This migration aims to:

- Reduce resource consumption and memory footprint
- Improve request handling speed and throughput
- Maintain the simplicity of the original Flapi API
- Add Go-specific optimizations and features

The core functionality of dynamic mock data generation remains unchanged, while benefiting from Go's efficient runtime and garbage collection.


## Status

This project is currently under development. Contributions are welcome!
